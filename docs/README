ABOUT

	Libmpsse is a library for interfacing with SPI/I2C devices via FTDI's FT-2232 family of USB to serial
	chips. Based around the libftdi library, it is written in C and includes a Python wrapper courtesy of
	swig.

CODE EXAMPLES

	There are SPI and I2C code examples for both C and Python in the src/examples directory. After installing
	libmpsse, the C examples can be built by running:

		$ make examples

	There are more detailed descriptions of the SPI and I2C APIs in docs/README.SPI and docs/README.I2C files.

BUILDING APPLICATIONS
	
	To build applications in Python, you must import the mpsse module:

		from mpsse import *

	To build applications in C, you must include the mpsse.h header file:

		#include <mpsse.h>
	
	...and also link your program against the libmpsse library:

		gcc test.c -o test -lmpsse

PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS

	In order to speak to SPI or I2C devices, you must establish the proper physical connections between the target
	device and your FTDI chip. The exact pin out of your target device and FTDI chip will differ based on the chips
	in question, and the appropriate data sheets for each device should be referenced for this information.

	Included in the docs directory is the FTDI MPSSE Basics application note (AN 135). Section 2 of this document
	covers all of the pin configurations for each FTDI chip, as well as example diagrams regarding the physical
	connections between the FTDI chip and your target device.
