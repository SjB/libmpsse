ABOUT

	Libmpsse is a library for interfacing with SPI/I2C devices via FTDI's FT2232 family of USB to serial
	chips. Based around the libftdi library, it is written in C and includes a Python wrapper courtesy of
	swig.

CODE EXAMPLES

	There are SPI and I2C code examples for both C and Python in the src/examples directory. After installing
	libmpsse, the C examples can be built by running:

		$ make examples

	There are more detailed descriptions of the SPI and I2C APIs in docs/README.SPI and docs/README.I2C files.

BUILDING APPLICATIONS
	
	To build applications in Python, you must import the mpsse module:

		from mpsse import *

	To build applications in C, you must include the mpsse.h header file:

		#include <mpsse.h>
	
	...and also link your program against the libmpsse library:

		gcc test.c -o test -lmpsse

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

	Although some code has been implemented for I2C support, it is currently untested. I2C support is planned for 
	future releases.
